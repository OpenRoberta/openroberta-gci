## Coding

Many of our Coding tasks are done via the [Lab](https://lab.open-roberta.org/), creating interesting programs to share them with others.
Make sure to check out the [Wiki](https://jira.iais.fraunhofer.de/wiki/display/ORInfo) for some general information about the robots and how to program them.

### NEPO tasks (tag nepo)

In these tasks you have to create a program in and for our [Lab](https://lab.open-roberta.org/).
It consists of a block based programming language called NEPO, which can be used to program many different robots.
As you probably do not own a robot, we offer a [simulation](https://jira.iais.fraunhofer.de/wiki/display/ORInfo/The+Open+Roberta+Lab#TheOpenRobertaLab-OpenRobertaSim) for the following robots:

- EV3
- NXT
- Calliope
- micro:bit

All of our tasks are solvable with the simulation and require no hardware.
The target audience of your programs are other Lab users.
Try to document your thought process and remember that your program is supposed to showcase and explain a specific behaviour.

If you pick one of these tasks the following steps are required:

- Create the specified program using the Lab
- Document your usage of blocks (with comment blocks) and why you are doing things in a specific way
- Use the program comment to give a general introduction to your program
- To provide the program do one of these:
  - export and upload the XML
  - share the program in the Lab with the `RobertaGCI` account and supply your **program name** and **account name**
  - (preferably) do both of the above
- Supply any additional information/material needed as required by the specific task

### GitHub tasks (tag github)

These tasks are very advanced and require knowledge of [git](https://git-scm.com/doc), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/).
Here are some references for [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), [adding remotes](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/adding-a-remote) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

In these tasks you will contribute to our [source code](https://github.com/OpenRoberta/openroberta-lab) directly.
Even if you want to start here immediately, be sure to tackle the task TBD first.
Other starter tasks for the Programming category are TBD and TBD, which you should also do before starting with other GitHub tasks.

When working on a task consider these points:

- Create your pull requests on our `develop` branch
- Focus on your task, do not make changes where they are not necessary, this makes them easier to review
- Try to touch as few files as possible
- Use our [formatter and save actions](https://github.com/OpenRoberta/openroberta-lab/wiki/Importing-into-Eclipse) to keep your code clean
