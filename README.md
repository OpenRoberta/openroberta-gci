## OpenRoberta Google Code-In

Welcome to our GCI page!

### Current information

GCI 2019 is over!
Thanks to all students who participated, it was a lot of fun for all of us to accompany and mentor you during GCI.

Special thanks to all of our mentors who provided support to the students!

### Communication

We are mostly communicating via [gitter](https://gitter.im/open-roberta-lab/GCI). If you have any general questions, come by our GCI channel, some mentors will be available there.

### General information

You can get comfy using the Lab [here](https://lab.open-roberta.org/).

Try creating some programs and running them in the simulation to get started and know what you will be working with or how your work is contributing to our open source software.
